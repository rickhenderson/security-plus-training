# Security+ Training
A set of exercises to help you learn about using computer security tools, and maybe help pass the Security+ exam. No promises though.

## Introduction
The CompTIA Security+ certification body of knowledge covering a number of concepts and tools. In the (section) titled "Technologies and Tools", you are introduced to a number of command line tools for Windows, Linux, and MacOS that can help you explore and troubleshoot local networks as well as remote systems and hosts.

## The Questions
It is my hope that I can provide a set of questions relating to each of the recommended tools that will give you **real world** examples and **hands-on** experience working with these tools. It is recommended you get familiar with these tools before you take the Security+ exam, according to Mike Chappel.
